## Current Projects

🎄 **[Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/ottjb/Advent-of-Code-2025)** – Solving daily programming challenges

🦀 **[Rust-Chip8](https://github.com/ottjb/rust-chip8)** – Building an emulator in Rust to understand low-level programming and computer architecture

🧬 **[NeuroEvolve](https://github.com/ottjb/neuroevolve)** – Terminal-based simulation combining genetic algorithms with neural networks using Python's Textual library

## Goals

- Master low-level systems programming as a foundation for quantum computing
- Deepen understanding of computer architecture through practical emulator development
- Explore the intersection of evolutionary computation and deep learning

## Past Work

**[Cross-Dataset-Generalization-Spam-Detection](https://github.com/ottjb/Cross-Dataset-Generalization-Spam-Detection)** - Developed an improved transformer model for email spam detection with enhanced feature engineering.
